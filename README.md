hey whats up 

I am here again...

Today I tried a new thing. I used a live background using SCSS and a couple of webkit keyframes 
(not sure what is it exactly but i ma gonna find out soon)

Anyway, this is my 4th project and i am gonna start working on the 5th one soon (actually tmr) 

Thankful to GOD for helping me with my learning. 

lots of love. 


One step closer to my success :)
